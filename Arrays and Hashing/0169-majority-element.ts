/**
 * Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm
We will sweep down the sequence starting at the first element.

As we sweep we maintain a pair consisting of a current candidate and a counter. Initially, the current candidate is unknown and the counter is 0.

When we move the pointer forward over an element e:

If the counter is 0, we set the current candidate to e and we set the counter to 1.
If the counter is not 0, we increment or decrement the counter according to whether e is the current candidate.

When we are done, the current candidate is the majority element, if there is a majority.
